# Love-Poem-Calc

The Love Calculator and Poem Generator is as straight forward as the name. The user will enter two names into the form, which will generate a poem in length based off of the percentage of your “love” match. Created during my time as a continuing education bootcamp student at Case Western Reserve University. This was a unique project that allowed me to use Ajax, two different API’s, typed.js, html, css, sass, and teamwork.
